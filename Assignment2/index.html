        <h1>Causes and Impact of Air Pollution</h1>
        <p class="intro">Air Pollution is one of the world's largest health and environmental problems that attributed
          to <span id="figure">11.65%</span>
          of deaths globally. Almost all of the global population <span id="figure">(99%) </span> are exposed to air
          pollution levels that put them at risk for diseases,
          such as cancer, pneumonia and etc. There has been a record of <span id="figure">6.7 million </span> deaths
          each year from exposure to ambient and household air pollution and
          a <span id="figure">2.4 billion </span> people primarily rely on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking.

      <h2>How is Air Pollution affected Globally?</h2>
      <section>
        <div id="choropleth_map"></div>
        <p class="text">The highest PM2.5 index recorded in 2017 is from <span id="blue">Niger</span> of <span
            id="figure">94.05</span> which is significantly higher than the rest of the world.
          Reported that the air pollution in Niger was caused by natural factors such as dust, sand, emmision of cars,
          industry waste, and more. Furthermore, countries such as <span id="blue">India</span>,
          <span id="blue">Egypt</span> and <span id="blue">Saudi Arabia </span>falls in to the few top countries with
          the highest PM2.5 index value.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Fortunately, country like india aims to reduce particulate matter emissions by much as <span id="figure">30%
          </span>
          from 2017 levels by 2024.

      <h2>What Causes Air Pollution?</h2>
      <section>
        <div id="causes"></div>

        <p class="text">In this visualisation shows the causes of air pollution recorded in the UK. It is clear that the
          main cause is due to
          <span id="blue">Small non-road mobile sources & machinery</span> which is the highest record of <span
            id="figure">46600 tonnes</span> emitted PM2.5 in the year 2016.



        <p class="text">
          This provides evidence on emissions from Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) and should set out recommendations
          for policy
          to reduce these emissions effectively. Moreover, same goes for the <span id="blue">Manufacturing Industry and
            Construction</span> manufacturing industry and construction

      <h2>What is the Pollutant Emitted?</h2>
      <section>
        <div id="emission"></div>
        <p class="text"> In this visualisation shows the trend in annual emissions of PM10, Pm2.5, nitorgen oxides,
          ammonia, volatile organic compounds
          and sulphur dioxide. As shown above, there has been a long-term decrease in emissions of all the air
          pollutants. <span id="blue">Volatile Organic Compound </span>
          reachest the peak of<span id="figure">115.55</span> index during 1990 but has decreased significantly moving
          forward.
          It is believed that the main factors for the decrease in emissions are due to the reduction in use of coal for
          domestic heating and
          power generation, stricter emissions regulation for road transport and change in farming practices.

          As shown above, Countries that is located in Africa and Asia has a higher Pm2.5 to death rate. For example,
          <span id="blue">Qatar</span> has a death rate of <span id="figure">150</span> and PM2.5 value of <span
